# Twitter-Data-Pipeline
Built a data pipeline using Python, Airflow, and Pandas to ETL data from the Twitter API. Deployed on AWS EC2 with DAG scheduling and S3 storage for scalable processing.

This end-to-end Data Engineering project showcases the use of Python, Apache Airflow, and AWS to build a robust and automated data pipeline. It involves extracting real-time data from the Twitter API, performing transformations using Python, orchestrating the ETL process with Airflow deployed on an EC2 instance, and storing the final outputs in Amazon S3. The project highlights practical experience with cloud-based data workflows, automation, and scalable architecture suitable for real-time analytics and large-scale data processing.
